this code tests whether you have vtk and vtktools sucessfully installed, and whether you can read in the solution fields from a vtu file.

If you have installed Paraview, the vtk python library (it might be automatically included with Paraview) and the vtktools library (https://github.com/FluidityProject/fluidity/tree/main/python), then you should be able to run the script:
python read_in_vtu.py
